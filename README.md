# Vending Machine Learning Sessions

This repository is for helping to learn a little bit of java.

Object oriented design/programming allows us to express the concepts related to the product we're developing or the processes we're automating in the code. Sometimes these are literal and other times metaphorical.

The world around us comprises of objects. For example tables, chairs, desks. A desk has many attributes. Some are things like its dimensions. Others are things like its draws. The draws themselves are also objects with their own attributes. They also have behaviours (lock, unlock, open, close). Othertimes objects can be metaphorical, such as a shopping basket on a shopping website.

Some of the topics that you can explore with this project are:
* Classes - Like a cookie cutter that makes it easy to create instances of the same type of thing
* Objects - instances of a class (the 'cookie')
* Primitives - There are some basic types of things (integers, characters, booleans etc)
* Variables - storing individual values
* Methods - behaviours exhibited by objects
* Basic access modifiers - Public and Private
* Simple Conditionals - making decisions
* Collections - different ways of storing things together
* Iteration - doing things with the items we've stored together
* Packages â€“ allows you to have classes with the same names but within different namespaces
